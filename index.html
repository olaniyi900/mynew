             expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
            human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
             but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that
             are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain 
             pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which 
            toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us 
            ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who 
            has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying 
            consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
